# Curlec Payment Gateway Setup Guide

## Overview
This durian farm e-commerce system uses **Curlec** as the payment gateway to accept payments from Malaysian customers via FPX (online banking), credit cards, and other local payment methods.

## What is Curlec?
Curlec is a Malaysian payment gateway that provides:
- âœ… FPX (online banking) - all major Malaysian banks
- âœ… Credit/Debit cards (Visa, Mastercard)
- âœ… E-wallets (coming soon)
- âœ… Low transaction fees
- âœ… Fast settlement (T+1 days)
- âœ… Built for Malaysian businesses

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Curlec Account

1. Go to [Curlec Website](https://curlec.com/)
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Get Started"
3. Fill in your business details:
   - Business name: "Your Durian Farm Name"
   - Business type: Agriculture / E-commerce
   - Email and phone number
4. Submit required documents:
   - SSM registration (for companies)
   - IC copy (for sole proprietors)
   - Bank account details for settlement
5. Wait for approval (usually 1-3 business days)

### 2. Get API Credentials

Once approved:

1. Login to [Curlec Dashboard](https://dashboard.curlec.com/)
2. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. You will see:
   - **Test Mode** keys (for development/testing)
   - **Live Mode** keys (for production)
4. Copy your API credentials:
   ```
   API Key: pk_test_xxxxx (or pk_live_xxxxx for production)
   API Secret: sk_test_xxxxx (or sk_live_xxxxx for production)
   ```

### 3. Configure Your App

1. Open your project folder
2. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   copy .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

3. Open `.env.local` and add your Curlec credentials:
   ```env
   # For Testing (use test keys)
   CURLEC_API_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
   CURLEC_API_SECRET=sk_test_your_secret_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3004

   # For Production (switch to live keys)
   # CURLEC_API_KEY=pk_live_your_key_here
   # CURLEC_API_SECRET=sk_live_your_secret_here
   # NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

4. Save the file and restart your development server

### 4. Set Up Webhook (Important!)

Webhooks notify your app when payments succeed/fail:

1. In Curlec Dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Webhooks**
2. Click "Add Endpoint"
3. Enter your webhook URL:
   - **Local testing**: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/curlec/webhook`
   - **Production**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/curlec/webhook`
4. Select events to listen to:
   - âœ… `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - âœ… `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - âœ… `payment_intent.canceled`
5. Save the webhook endpoint

**Note**: For local testing, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your localhost:
```bash
ngrok http 3004
```

## How the Payment Flow Works

### Step 1: Customer Places Order
1. Customer visits `/order` page
2. Selects durian varieties and quantities
3. Fills in delivery information
4. Clicks "Proceed to Payment"

### Step 2: Create Payment Intent
1. Frontend sends order to `/api/curlec/create-payment`
2. Backend creates payment intent with Curlec API
3. Returns payment URL to customer

### Step 3: Customer Pays
1. Customer redirected to Curlec payment page
2. Customer selects FPX and their bank
3. Customer logs into online banking
4. Customer authorizes payment

### Step 4: Payment Confirmation
1. Curlec processes payment
2. Sends webhook to your app with payment status
3. Customer redirected to `/payment/success` page
4. Order saved to database
