        && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'owner';
    }

    // Orders - customers can read their own, admin can read all
    match /customer_orders/{orderId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null
        && (resource.data.customerId == request.auth.uid
            || get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role in ['owner', 'manager']);
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null
        && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role in ['owner', 'manager'];
    }

    // Reviews - authenticated users can create, own or admin can update
    match /product_reviews/{reviewId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null
        && (resource.data.customerId == request.auth.uid
