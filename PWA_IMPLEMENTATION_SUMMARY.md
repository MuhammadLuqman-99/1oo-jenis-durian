## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Service Worker Strategy

```javascript
// API Requests: Network First
fetch() -> cache fallback -> offline response

// Images: Cache First
cache -> fetch and update cache

// Pages: Network First
fetch and cache -> cache fallback -> offline.html
```

### Background Sync

```javascript
// Automatically syncs when online
navigator.serviceWorker.sync.register('sync-health-records');
navigator.serviceWorker.sync.register('sync-tree-updates');
```

### Camera API

```javascript
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: { facingMode: 'environment', width: 1920, height: 1080 }
})
```

### Geolocation API

```javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
  callback,
  error,
  { enableHighAccuracy: true, timeout: 10000 }
)
```

4. **Sync regularly**: Open app when online to sync pending data

### For Best Camera Quality

1. **Good lighting**: Natural light works best
2. **Clean lens**: Wipe camera before taking photos
3. **Steady hands**: Hold phone steady
4. **Multiple angles**: Take photos from different sides

### For Accurate GPS

1. **Open area**: Best accuracy away from buildings
2. **Wait for lock**: Wait for "Excellent" or "Good" accuracy
3. **Clear weather**: GPS works best in clear conditions
